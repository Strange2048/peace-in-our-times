## The Case for Cannabis Warfare: A Provocative Strategy in the Israel-Hamas Conflict

Each aid truck entering Gaza from Israel should contain at least one standard size pallet (48×40 inches) filled with boxes of 10-ounce bags of high-quality cannabis, rolling papers, and filters. By high-quality Cannabis, I mean no less than the quality of Israeli medical cannabis. Usage instructions, disclaimers, and a warning badge alerting consumers not to use before the age of 21 will be printed on each bag, in three languages: Arabic, English, and Hebrew.

Israel should be fully transparent about this initiative and decriminalize/legalize Cannabis on the same day it starts shipping cannabis to Gaza. This should legally safeguard against accusations of biological warfare.

Israel should open an international fund for purchasing cannabis for Gaza. Invite Snoop Dogg to sample the pallets at the border. Throw a Nova festival 2.0. Invite the UN to monitor the distribution. Are Gazans worried about being poisoned? Let the hostages sample test it. Grow the cannabis in western Negev Kibbutzim, pillaged villages from October 7th. Encourage people to sell "cannabis bags for Palestine" on Amazon. DON'T APOLOGIZE!

Israel's official message should be along the lines of, "All sides of the conflict should relax and contemplate their lives. We believe this measure might help prevent the next war. It's a legal substance and we believe it will help heal lost souls. This is a form of humanitarian aid."

### How should Gazans react to this? It could go in many ways....

Few things to remember:
1. Each pallet worth a lot of money (potentially more than the entire aid truck cargo combined)
2. Cannabis is prohibited by Sharia law
3. Hamas isn't tolerant to cannabis use
4. Cigarette smoking is very common among Gazans

Hypothetical micro and macro scenarios that may cascade in some order:
* Truckers strike and refuse to deliver the trucks
* Aid trucks and border crossing are attacked
* The median Gazan is indifferent to it
* Gazans protest against the Cannabis shipments
* Gazans anonymously thank Israel for the Cannabis
* Hamas destroys it
* New Islamic fatwas against Cannabis
* Hamas collect it as future currency
* Hamas is fighting the Cannabis flood in the markets
* Smokers are persecuted
* Smokers seek asylum in Israel
* Kids smoke
* Kids eat Cannabis and get hospitalized
* Gazans send Cannabis kites to Israel
* Drug dealing Gangs arise
* Civil unrest – people die fighting over Cannabis
* Gazan/Hamas sell it back to Israel
* More Gazans get high
* More Gazans with mental disorders due to Cannabis abuse
* Hamas is selling the Cannabis worldwide through Egypt
* Hamas becomes rich from Cannabis (and now dependent on Israel Cannabis shipments)
* Gazans start farming Cannabis
* Full bloody civil war in Gaza over cannabis crisis
* Hamas uses the Cannabis money for more terror against Israel
* Kids are trafficking Cannabis
* Gazan martyr pool is shrinking
* Gazan martyr pool is growing
* Hamas attacks Israel
* Hamas adapts and finds a strategy to defuse the Cannabis warfare
* Gaza becomes Jamaica
* New branch of ultra radical Islam emerges – High Islam.

### What was the thinking process behind all of this?

A military solution is very unlikely in the 21st century rules of engagements and the current political world order. The only way to end the war is “break” the Gazan death culture from within. Hamas wants Gazans to die, Israel should not fall into this trap, make them high instead. Sow division in their culture just like the Islamist are sowing division in the west.

Culture behaves like biological organisms, Islamist countries infected the west with the radical Islam pathogen. While the Islamist countries seem to be more immune to radical Islam, the west just isn’t. It's akin to the [Princess Bride Iocaine scene](https://youtu.be/rMz7JBRbmNo?si=srUa2xF1PbdgQnfC) – the west is Vizzini.

It traps the west in a classic catch 22: lose demographically and we will take your freedoms or self-defend by taking away your own freedoms (speech legislation, mass surveillance, curfews, police state etc.).

Back to Gaza, the only way out of this cluster-fuck is either more carnage or weakening the host (Gaza) by infecting it with a western pathogen which Israel is less susceptible to. This is also sending a powerful message to the Islamists; more freedoms, not less.

### Will it work?

Maybe.

The world will probably freak out, many westerners' brains will break. It will first appear as an over-the-top move that plays into the hands of Antisemites. Israel should be prepared to sell it well (not holding my breath here) and double down on framing it as a humanitarian aid.

Egypt might turn aggressive about it - a big hurdle. It is also possible that Egypt will turn a blind eye and benefit from money laundering.

It has the potential to escalate into a regional war. If the product hits the “wrong” markets. It might destabilize current middle eastern regimes.

The United Nations will melt down over this.

Israel will probably be sued in Hauge. If I was the prime minister of Israel, I would gladly take it all on me and appear in court with a big blunt hanging from the side of my mouth (is it legal in Hauge?). A small sacrifice for many souls.

It could turn into a PR nightmare for Israel plus a war criminal prime minister plus zero effect on Gazans or Hamas. A soft failure. No one died. The prime minister might be the 21st century Gandhi.

Israel will pay a dear mental price for the Cannabis pathogen. Israel should carefully prepare the legalization/decriminalization through its relatively effective health care branch to minimize the Cannabis exposure to people under 21.

Israel should be extremely attentive to Gazan street and be willing to stop the Cannabis shipments at any time if it undermines its interest. Some folks in Gaza would probably be upset if the supply was suddenly stopped – so this could turn into a political lever.

“success” (weaken radical Islam) will most likely come with unpredictable chaos and many more dead bodies – it’s the middle east after all. So, we shouldn't delude ourselves, unleashing psycho active substance into the Gazan trauma is very hard to predict.

### What is success?

Gazans become more tolerant to Jews. It may take a generation.

### Conclusion:

This has the potential to open a can of worms of diabolical global warfare strategies (i.e. China flooding the USA with Fentanyl). Israel should take the moral high ground and apply the same standard to its own citizens.

The risks are high, but also the rewards. This is either this, or another 100 years of brutal war and misery.

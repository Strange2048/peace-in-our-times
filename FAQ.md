## Frequently Asked Questions

the article makes a lot of implicit assumptions, I'll try to answer some of them here.

### Drug the Gazans?!

Yes, but not all Gazans. Even in legalized countries, not everyone uses Cannabis. Cannabis as accessible commodity in Gaza. The people who want to use it will use it and the rest just won't.

Most people who will use it will be tilting more peacefully. The larger this group of people is, the greater the impact on the Gazans politics. A target group of 10% of the population can make a big difference.

Who knows? Maybe we’ll later discover that cannabis was actually one of the contributors of the west tilting more pacifistic in the last two generations.

### Isn't that illegal?

Yes. This kind of drug tactic is illegal under international law. But what if it's a medicine in Israel?

What if the alternative is possibly a hundred times worse?

You can argue that it's part of the medical package to treat PTSD Gazans. I am not a legal expert, but it seems there might be some gray here.

This is an Eisenhower's dilemma in magnitude.

### Is it ethical?

This is an ethical mine-field. This strategy is undermining centuries of assumptions on warfare. It basically implies that we might have lesser evil options in warfare that we haven't yet explored.

It will surely rock the warfare ethics world. It can either get ugly or it can be a game changer - a new tool for extreme de-escalation.

### Isn't this plays conveniently into the hands of Antisemites?

Yes. This is one of the reasons why this is a very risky move.

Israel should be prepared to sell it well and double down on framing it as a humanitarian aid.

Israel should trial balloon the public opinion before jumping into this. and proceed only if public opinion seems positive, make a small pilot and follow the reaction closely and adjust repeatedly. Israel should be humble about it and revert if it no longer serves its interest.

### Cannabis makes people more peaceful?

There's seems to be correlation between Cannabis usage and pacifistic bent. The fact that we overlook this phenomenon is puzzling to me.

By "pacifistic bent" I mean a tendency to avoid violence, not a tendency to be a pacifist.

### Cannabis is a pathogen?

Yes. It's a numbing drug, and It's not good for the brain. It's addictive (less than cigarettes).

### Cannabis is a western pathogen?

Generally, yes. see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_annual_cannabis_use

### Israel is more resilient to Cannabis than Gazans?

27% of Israel total population reported smoking at least once last year.

Israel is 1st in the world in annual cannabis use rates

Our best survey from Gaza suggests 1.8% usage across males.

These are indeed two different survey methods, but the difference is too big to be explained by that. For anyone intimately familiar with those two societies these numbers are not a shock.

To my knowledge, Israel isn’t severely impaired by the Cannabis pathogen. Right now, this is like problem #127 in Israel’s list.

### If Cannabis equals pacifism, how do you explain Israel current behavior?

This is how peaceniks fight. Grab yourself a history book.

### What do you mean when you say "the west"?

Europe, the Anglosphere, Japan, South Korea, Israel and all those who **Proudly** wave the flag of individual freedoms and a transparent democracy.

### Isn't that offensive to Islam?

It will surely be perceived that way.

It will upset many people, but then again, so does the current situation.

Israel can argue that there's no Cannabis references in the Quran and each scholar can interpret it as he sees, and that this is a kind of an "olive branch" to the Gazans.

### Isn't that offensive to the Gazans?

Yes. But so does the alternative (conventional war).

### Are you suggesting a kumbaya solution?

No and yes

No: Israel should keep applying military pressure on Hamas and keep pulling other levers to de-radicalize Gaza. This is a supplement to that.

Yes: It'll register as a kumbaya move to many people. The coalition of supporters for this move will be a surprising one.

If we frame the problem as "mass de-radicalization of people", then I see no evidence that the current outsourcing strategy (UNRWA/The Arab world as an adult) is working. Maybe we should explore new ideas?

### How do you think it'll affect Hamas?

It will be an annoyance to Hamas. I don't know to what extent. 

It has some potential to corrupt some of them and make them more suspicious of each other. 

It might also make them more paranoid and aggressive towards their fellow countrymen.

This can be a lever in a hostage negotiation.

### It may deteriorate into a Cannabis epidemic?

Very true. This is a risk. But it's a risk that can hopefully be managed if we regulate the Cannabis like cigarettes/prescription drugs.
